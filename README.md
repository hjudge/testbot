# testbot

### Commands 

This bot passes an address to the [Mapbox Geocoding API](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#geocoding), which returns a centerpoint (lat/long). This centerpoint is then passed to the [Mapbox Static API](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#static), and returns a map in Slack. 

To enable the bot: 
` address <query>`
